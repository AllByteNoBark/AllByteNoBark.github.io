# Visual Novel Engine

Visual Novel Engine is a mainly JavaScript app that provides the necessary functions for anyone to easily create their own visual novel game.
The project is far from finished but it already provides the functions needed to create a simple visual novel with simple features.

## Getting Started

To get started with your own visual novel you need to clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/AllByteNoBark/AllByteNoBark.github.io.git
```
Or, alternatively, you can download and extract the zip file of this repository.

To write your own visual novel, you'll need to update the index.html file and the code inside its last <script> tag.

### Sample

There are already images and audio files included inside the assets folder, and a simple short story in index.html as an example.

## Built With

  - JavaScript, HTML and CSS only.
